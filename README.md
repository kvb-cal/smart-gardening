Smart Gardening System using IOT

In this system we use NodeMCU, soil moisture sensors
and motor pump. The motor will get switched ON/OFF depending upon
the soil moisture condition and the condition of motor can be displayed
on OLED. The values of the various sensor are also relayed to a cloud
which can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
